Ideas

"Map Inventory"
- Display only in cleared rooms, unnecessary info during combat
- Bar of pickupable "maps" that may be placed in the ui map to create rooms
- The items in the hotbar should show info about the type of rooms
e.g.
Room type (enemy, heal, treasure)
Room difficulty (Based on number/enemy difficulty)
Reward level?
Augments (add special border if augmented, hover over for tooltip with details)
- Should have some way to dispose of maps without dropping back on floor
- Carry limit


Map Augment Ideas:
Enemies deal double damage, room completion guarentees at least


Augment Table:
Can be used on 1 map
Allows choice between 3 augments, then re roll available augments x times
Destroy on use
UI can be integrated, no need to open menu.
