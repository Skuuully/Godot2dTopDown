Most basic of map systems implemented, new grid that can be clicked in which instances a room at a given position, rooms overlap with current existing, no way to know which room you are in


Updated damage system, add a damageable miniscene and in parent set hp value and listen to damageTaken and death signals
Fixed the pathfinding and the player shooting behaviour.

- Work on adding ui for the player, should follow the camera staying in the top left of the screen.
- When player takes damage, the damage should be propagated out to the ui and be informed and update.
- Follow the tutorial on a "shockwave" shader effect, this should be played when the player takes damage. (To fully sell the shockwave enemies + bullets? should be pushed back some amount)
- On player taking damage the player should flash (set alpha to low then back to normal and back) during said time player should not be able to retake damage
- Add collision so that when the enemy collides with the player all above happen.
