TopDown working notes:

Working:
Room generation/level generation
Drag n drop ui with cards
Player stats
Pickupable items for player buffs
Enemy types
Any kind of Audio
Sprites/Animation
Mellee that deflects enemy bullets
Some damage system that works better than current implementation





Finished:
Fixed the pathfinding and the player shooting behaviour.

- Work on adding ui for the player, should follow the camera staying in the top left of the screen.
- When player takes damage, the damage should be propagated out to the ui and be informed and update.
- Follow the tutorial on a "shockwave" shader effect, this should be played when the player takes damage. (To fully sell the shockwave enemies + bullets? should be pushed back some amount)
- On player taking damage the player should flash (set alpha to low then back to normal and back) during said time player should not be able to retake damage
- Add collision so that when the enemy collides with the player all above happen.
